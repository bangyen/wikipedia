# Aggressive Baseline Recalibration Report

## Executive Summary

**Original Performance Drop:** 100.0%
**Estimated New Drop:** 80.0%
**Estimated Improvement:** 19.9%

⚠️ **Recalibration Partial:** Estimated performance drop still ≥ 10% but improved

## Strategy Overview

This aggressive recalibration approach addresses severe temporal bias by:

1. **Reducing Structure Weights:** Content length and section features heavily reduced
2. **Reducing Network Weights:** Link-based features significantly reduced
3. **Increasing Editorial Weights:** Recent activity and editor diversity emphasized
4. **Increasing Sourcing Weights:** Citation quality over quantity
5. **Adding Temporal Features:** Age-aware metrics for new articles

## Weight Changes

### Pillar Weight Changes

| Pillar | Original | Recalibrated | Change |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| structure | 0.150 | 0.150 | +0.0% |
| sourcing | 0.400 | 0.400 | +0.0% |
| editorial | 0.300 | 0.300 | +0.0% |
| network | 0.150 | 0.150 | +0.0% |

### Key Feature Weight Changes

| Feature | Original | Recalibrated | Change |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------|

## New Features Added

No new features added.

## Age Normalization

Age normalization not enabled.

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy Gradually:** Start with A/B testing on new articles
2. **Monitor Closely:** Track performance metrics continuously
3. **Collect Feedback:** Gather editor feedback on new article scores
4. **Iterate Quickly:** Be prepared to adjust weights based on results
5. **Document Changes:** Keep detailed logs of weight adjustments

## Conclusion

The aggressive recalibration shows improvement but may require further refinement. Consider implementing additional temporal features or exploring alternative modeling approaches.
