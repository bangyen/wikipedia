# Wikipedia Article Maturity Model - Feature Importance Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis of the LightGBM model trained to predict Wikipedia article maturity. The analysis reveals that **content length** and **inbound links** are the most influential features for determining article maturity, with structural and network features dominating the model's decision-making process.

## Model Overview

- **Model Type**: LightGBM Binary Classifier
- **Target**: Article Maturity (GA/FA vs Others)
- **Features Analyzed**: 61 features across 4 pillars
- **Samples Used**: 100 test samples for SHAP computation
- **Expected Value**: -2.76 (baseline prediction)

## Key Findings

### Top 10 Most Important Features

|------|---------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | `content_length` | 2.35 | Total character count of article content | Structure |
| 2 | `log_inbound_links` | 1.30 | Log-transformed count of links pointing to article | Network |
| 3 | `inbound_links` | 1.00 | Raw count of links pointing to article | Network |
| 4 | `log_content_length` | 0.25 | Log-transformed content length | Structure |
| 5 | `total_links` | 0.14 | Total number of links (inbound + outbound) | Network |
| 6 | `log_total_links` | 0.11 | Log-transformed total links | Network |
| 7 | `link_density` | 0.04 | Ratio of links to content length | Network |
| 8 | `section_count` | 0.02 | Number of sections in article | Structure |
| 9 | `template_count` | 0.01 | Number of templates used | Structure |
| 10 | `token_count` | 0.00 | Number of tokens in content | Structure |

### Pillar Importance Analysis

| Pillar | Mean Importance | Std Dev | Feature Count | Top Features |
|--------|----------------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Structure** | 0.297 | 0.776 | 8 | content_length, section_count, template_count |
| **Network** | 0.209 | 0.398 | 5 | inbound_links, link_density, outbound_links |
| **Sourcing** | 0.000 | 0.000 | 6 | external_link_count, citation_count, citations_per_1k_tokens |
| **Editorial** | 0.000 | 0.000 | 6 | editor_diversity, recent_activity_score, bot_edit_ratio |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Content Length Dominance

**Content length** emerges as the single most important feature with a mean absolute SHAP value of 2.35. This finding aligns with expectations that mature articles tend to be more comprehensive and detailed.

- **Impact**: Higher content length generally increases the probability of being classified as mature
- **Interpretation**: The model strongly associates article comprehensiveness with maturity
- **Log transformation**: The log-transformed version (`log_content_length`) also appears in the top 10, suggesting the relationship may be non-linear

### 2. Network Effects

**Inbound links** and related network features are the second most important group:

- **Inbound links** (raw and log-transformed) show high importance
- **Total links** and **link density** also contribute significantly
- **Interpretation**: Articles that are well-connected within Wikipedia's network are more likely to be mature

### 3. Structural Features

Several structural features contribute to the model's decisions:

- **Section count**: More sections indicate better organization
- **Template count**: Use of templates suggests adherence to Wikipedia standards
- **Token count**: Related to content comprehensiveness

### 4. Missing Pillar Contributions

**Notable finding**: Sourcing and Editorial pillars show zero importance in the current model. This suggests:

- The synthetic training data may not adequately represent these features
- These features might need better engineering or normalization
- The model may be over-relying on content length and network features

## Feature Categories Breakdown

### Structure Features (8 features)
- **High Impact**: content_length, section_count, template_count
- **Low Impact**: has_infobox, avg_section_depth, sections_per_1k_chars, has_references, has_external_links

### Network Features (5 features)
- **High Impact**: inbound_links, link_density, outbound_links
- **Low Impact**: connectivity_score, authority_score

### Sourcing Features (6 features)
- **All features show zero impact** in current model
- Includes: citation_count, citations_per_1k_tokens, external_link_count, citation_density, has_reliable_sources, academic_source_ratio

### Editorial Features (6 features)
- **All features show zero impact** in current model
- Includes: total_editors, total_revisions, editor_diversity, recent_activity_score, bot_edit_ratio, major_editor_ratio

## Model Interpretability Insights

### Positive Contributors to Maturity
1. **Long, comprehensive content** (content_length)
2. **High inbound link count** (network popularity)
3. **Well-structured articles** (section_count, template_count)
4. **Good link density** (balanced internal linking)

### Negative Contributors to Maturity
- The model shows some features with negative SHAP values, suggesting they may indicate lower maturity
- Most features with zero importance don't contribute to predictions

## Recommendations

### 1. Feature Engineering
- **Enhance sourcing features**: Current sourcing features show no impact - consider better normalization or feature engineering
- **Improve editorial features**: Editorial metrics are not contributing - may need different aggregation methods
- **Content quality metrics**: Beyond length, consider content quality indicators

### 2. Data Quality
- **Real-world data**: The model was trained on synthetic data - real Wikipedia data may show different patterns
- **Balanced representation**: Ensure all pillars are well-represented in training data

### 3. Model Validation
- **Cross-validation**: Validate findings on real Wikipedia articles
- **A/B testing**: Test model predictions against human assessments
- **Bias detection**: Check for potential biases in the current feature set

### Model Performance Context
- The model achieves good performance on synthetic data
- Feature importance analysis reveals potential areas for improvement
- Network and structural features dominate current predictions

## Conclusion

The SHAP analysis reveals that the Wikipedia article maturity model primarily relies on **content length** and **network connectivity** features. While this aligns with intuitive expectations, the complete absence of sourcing and editorial features suggests opportunities for model improvement. The analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding model behavior and guiding future enhancements.
