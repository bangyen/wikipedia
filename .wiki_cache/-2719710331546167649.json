It is a unique type of Midwestern cuisine, made distinct by its heavy Nordic influence.\nTypical Minnesota cuisine is based on 19th-century Norwegian and Swedish cuisine, with influence from German, Czech, Cornish, Italian, and Polish cuisine and minor Native American influences (mainly seen through the use of wild rice). Since the 1960s, food developed, produced, and sold in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area, known as the \"Twin Cities\", has been influenced by the cuisines of immigrant and refugee groups that have settled in Minnesota; immigrant cuisines common in Minnesota include Thai, Hmong, Vietnamese, and Laotian cuisine. Minnesotan cuisine also has regional variations, such as fusion cuisine and New Nordic cuisine in the Twin Cities, which is home to the inventions of the Jucy Lucy and the Bundt cake. Italian-inspired dishes and Cornish pasties are common in the Iron Range, along with Eastern European and Scandinavian dishes. German influence is more prevalent on the western prairies. Lake fish is most common on the North Shore.\nDishes uniquely associated with Minnesota cuisine include hotdish, fried walleye, Jucy Lucys, wild rice soup, lutefisk, lefse, and desserts such as scotcheroos, dessert salads, kransekake, and baked apples. Minnesota is the namesake of Minnesota sushi, Minnesota goulash, and Minnesota-style pizza. Regionally, porketta, potica, and pasties are well-known dishes of the Iron Range.\nFoods typical in Minnesota cuisine are generally affordable, filling, and hearty, befitting Minnesota's long, cold winters. The majority of dishes are comfort foods. Minnesotan foods are also rarely spicy. Though not typical Minnesota cuisine, archetypal fair foods are offered at the Minnesota State Fair, including dozens of foods offered \"on a stick\", such as Pronto Pups and deep-fried candy bars."}}}}
