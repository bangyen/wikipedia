As the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Rebekahs began as an all-white organization, typical at the time, that purported to promote reciprocity and charity, and drew inspiration from Judeo-Christian ethics.\nThe Independent Order of Odd Fellows originally limited membership to white men only, as was typical at the time; the Rebekahs began as the female auxiliary of the IOOF. Initially, only relatives such as wives or daughters of IOOF members were admitted as members.\nCurrently, both the IOOF and the Rebekahs admit both female and male members. Women today need not be related to an Odd Fellow to be a member of the Rebekahs. As long as she meets the moral, ethical, and age requirements for admission, any woman may join. In most jurisdictions, women aged 16 or 18 years old and above can join a Rebekah Lodge."}}}}
