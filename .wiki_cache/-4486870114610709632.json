The group were a popular subject in religious art throughout Germany and the Low Countries, especially during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but rarely after the Council of Trent.  According to this medieval tradition, Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary, was grandmother not just to Jesus but also to five of the twelve apostles: John the Evangelist, James the Greater, James the Less, Simon and Jude. These apostles, together with John the Baptist, were all cousins of Jesus. \nSmaller groups of Jesus and his parents, often plus his cousin John the Baptist and John's mother Elizabeth (Gospel of Luke 1:36) and perhaps Saint Anne, are known as the Holy Family, and were considerably more common in art. After the Council of Trent dismissed the legend of the three marriages of Anne, the full subject was thereafter rarely painted, although the limited group of the families of the cousins Jesus and John the Baptist remained in use."}}}}
