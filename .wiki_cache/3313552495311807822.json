They likely also include many Canadians of Latin-American ethnic origin who use the term \"Spanish\" as a panethnic ethnonym rather than only their specific country of ancestry. For example, someone whose familial origins are from El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia or Guatemala may call themself \"Spanish\" to identify with the larger Spanish speaking community. See Latin American Canadian for more information. \nThe laws in Spain (see Spanish nationality law) limit who may be granted Spanish citizenship from Latin America to parents and grandparents who once held Spanish citizenship. More recently the legal system in Spain has granted citizenship to Cubans who can prove that their grandparents immigrated to Cuba during the Spanish Civil War (see Historical Memory Law)."}}}}
