These laws, which provide the basis for Newtonian mechanics, can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nA body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by a force.\nAt any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.\nIf two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.\nThe three laws of motion were first stated by Isaac Newton in his Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), originally published in 1687. Newton used them to investigate and explain the motion of many physical objects and systems. In the time since Newton, new insights, especially around the concept of energy, built the field of classical mechanics on his foundations. In modern times, limitations to Newton's laws have been discovered; new theories were consequently developed, such as quantum mechanics and relativity to address the physics of objects in more extreme cases."}}}}
